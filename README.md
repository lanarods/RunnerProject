Jason, Samantha, Ravi, Sheila, and Ankit are preparing for an upcoming
marathon. Each day of the week they run certain miles and write them into
a notebook. At the end of the week, they would like to know the number
of miles run each day, the total miles for the week, and average miles run
each day.
